# ServiceNow-QE-Hackathon
**Source code is not available outside of the ServiceNow company due to company policy. However, I uploaded screenshots of the project in a powerpoint.**

This ServiceNow hackathon project called Yukidachi was created in a ServiceNow QE Hackathon. The purpose of the project was to create a user or a Yukadachi that has health points and life skills. There is also a game implemented that the user can play to gain tokens that they can use at the store developed in the project. At the store, they can buy items with their tokens to boost their health and lifeskills. The user can also follow and make friends with other users on the ServiceNow instance. 

This project was supposed to contain two .xml files that are Update Sets containing code that can be uploaded to the ServiceNow instance. However, due to company policy, only people employed by ServiceNow can view the .xml files. In this repository, there is a powerpoint that contains screenshots of the final project.
