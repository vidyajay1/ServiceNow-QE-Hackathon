# ServiceNow-QE-Hackathon
**Source code is not available outside of ServiceNow due to company policy.**

This ServiceNow hackathon project called Yukidachi was created in a ServiceNow QE Hackathon. The purpose of the project was to create a user or a Yukadachi that has health points and life skills. There is also a game implemented that the user can play to gain tokens that they can use at the store developed in the project. In the game, the user guesses a color. The computer generates a random color and if the user guesses the same color as the randomly generated color, then the user wins.  At the store, they can buy items with their tokens to boost their health and lifeskills. The user can also follow and make friends with other users on the ServiceNow instance. 

This project was supposed to contain .xml files that are Update Sets containing code that can be uploaded to the ServiceNow instance. However, due to company policy, only people employed by ServiceNow can view the .xml files. In this repository, there is a powerpoint that contains screenshots of the final project. There is also a screen recording of the color game. (I am logged into the instance as an administrator and not a user, so the game does not show amount of boost points, tokens or the mood at the top.)
